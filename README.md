# Linear-Regression-GUI
 
This is a GUI that I created in order to help for better visualization of simple linear regression.
I used matplotlib to make the plot which displays the points and the best-fitting line, while for creating the GUI I used tkinter widgets.
This is my first project in python, so every feedback regarding coding structure and techniques are welcome.
